title: "About Me"
---

My name is Yixiao Sun, and you can call me Alvin. My interests generally lie in the intersection
between robotics control and perception. My previous experiences span a broad range of areas
including computer vision, 3D geometry, optimization, applied deep learning, and embedded systems. 

Currently, I am a graduate student in the MechE
department at Stanford, and I am also a member of [Autonomous System Lab](https://asl.stanford.edu)
advised by [Professor Marco Pavone](https://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/). My focus now 
is on uncertainty calibration for deep ML models and exploring how a robot autonomy stack
can reliably fuse in information from deep models.

Prior to joining Stanford, I graduated with highest honors from UIUC with a B.S. in 
Computer Engineering. At UIUC, I was deeply involved in 
[Illini RoboMaster](https://github.com/illini-robomaster), a robotics club 
created by myself and a few friends. 
From where I gained a lot of experience in real-time embedded systems and visuomotor 
control algorithms. I have also held internships with [Megvii](https://en.megvii.com/) 
and [Skydio](https://www.skydio.com) where I developed skills in deep visual tracking
and real-time deep model deployment.

## Hobbies
I spend most of my free time on music and sports.

Piano has been with me since I was 5 and it has never left. I love classical
and modern pieces and anything in between. My favorite pianists are 
[Jarrod Radnich](http://jarrodradnich.com/), [Peter Bence](http://peterbence.com/), 
and [David Hicken](https://davidhicken.com/).

Volleyball has become a big part of my life since I joined Stanford. Now I play both
indoor and beach volleyball in the intramural leagues as Outside Hitter or Middle Blocker.

Skiing (and snowboarding) has always been one my favorite sports. I am aiming to learn
more spins and grabs in the coming years. During off season time, rollerblade 
serves as my dry-land practice.
